# **Get Average of Numbers with While Loops**
### **IFSL1T07 - Beginner Control Structures â€” Loops**

## **Description**
This program uses while loops to repeatedly prompt the user to enter any number, store the inputted numbers in an array, and stop prompting when the user enters '-1'. It outputs the average of these numbers (excluding -1) to the console and as an alert.
<br>

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repo and open with your preferred IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)).
2. In the IDE, open the while.html file and click the 'run' button, or click 'Go Live' if using VSCode. This should open your browser automatically to your localhost port number with '/while.html' as the URL endpoint.

<br>

## **How to Use**
1. Once the html file is loaded in your browser, a popup window will appear asking you to enter a number repeatedly.
2. Follow the instructions to enter as many numbers as you like, and enter -1 when you want to stop adding numbers. This will stop requesting input and will calculate and return the average of all the numbers inputted.
