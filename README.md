# **Get Average of Numbers with While Loops**

## **Description**
This program uses while loops to repeatedly prompts the user to enter any number, stores the inputted numbers in an array, and stops prompting when the user enters '-1'. It outputs the average of these numbers (excluding -1) to the console and as an alert.
