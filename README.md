# **Get Average of Numbers with While Loops**

## **Description**
This program uses while loops to repeatedly prompt the user to enter any number, store the inputted numbers in an array, and stop prompting when the user enters '-1'. It outputs the average of these numbers (excluding -1) to the console and as an alert.
